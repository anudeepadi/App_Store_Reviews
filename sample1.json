So I just got it back and apparently I can\u2019t get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve tried a bunch of times. It\u2019s probably a bug. Anyways, my second \u201cbut\u201d is that even if you don\u2019t want an account and your trust trying out the app, don\u2019t pull up the pop-up that says \u201cSIGN UP\u201d or \u201cLOGIN IN\u201d. I honestly don\u2019t want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don\u2019t have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it\u2019s tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I\u2019m trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don\u2019t want to see the pop-up where it says to \u201cSIGN IN\u201d or to \u201cLOGIN IN\u201d. Please don\u2019t get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review. Hope it\u2019s well enough for ideas. Stay safe! Happy Holidays!!!\n\n-Your fellow TikTok Fan.",
